### Rule: Exchange must use encryption for RPC client access.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259645r960759_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This setting controls whether client machines are forced to use secure channels to communicate with the server. If this feature is enabled, clients will only be able to communicate with the server over secure communication channels. Failure to require secure connections to the client access server increases the potential for unintended eavesdropping or data loss.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Exchange must use encryption for Outlook Web App (OWA) access.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259646r960759_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This setting controls whether client machines should be forced to use secure channels to communicate with this virtual directory. If this feature is enabled, clients will only be able to communicate with the directory if they are capable of supporting secure communication with the server. The use of secure communication prevents eavesdroppers from reading or modifying communications between servers and clients. The network and DMZ STIG identify criteria for OWA and Public Folder configuration in the network, including Common Access Card (CAC)-enabled preauthentication through an application firewall proxy. Failure to require secure connections on a website increases the potential for unintended eavesdropping or data loss.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Exchange must have forms-based authentication enabled.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259647r960759_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Identification and Authentication provide the foundation for access control. Access to email services applications in the DOD requires authentication using DOD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates. Authentication for Outlook Web App (OWA) is used to enable web access to user email mailboxes and should assume that certificate-based authentication has been configured. This setting controls whether forms-based logon should be used by the OWA website. Because the DOD requires Common Access Card (CAC)-based authentication to applications, OWA access must be brokered through an application proxy or other preauthenticator, which performs CAC authentication prior to arrival at the CA server. The authenticated request is then forwarded directly to OWA, where authentication is repeated without requiring the user to repeat authentication steps. For this scenario to work, the Application Proxy server must have forms-based authentication enabled, and Exchange must have forms-based Authentication disabled. If forms-based Authentication is enabled on the Exchange CA server, it is evidence that the application proxy server is either not correctly configured, or it may be missing.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Exchange must have administrator audit logging enabled.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259648r960780_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Unauthorized or malicious data changes can compromise the integrity and usefulness of the data. Automated attacks or malicious users with elevated privileges have the ability to effect change using the same mechanisms as email administrators. Auditing any changes to access mechanisms not only supports accountability and nonrepudiation for those authorized to define the environment but also enables investigation of changes made by others who may not be authorized. Note: This administrator auditing feature audits all exchange changes regardless of the user's assigned role or permissions.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Exchange servers must use approved DOD certificates.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259649r960792_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Server certificates are required for many security features in Exchange; without them, the server cannot engage in many forms of secure communication.

**Group ID:** `V-259650`

### Rule: Exchange must have authenticated access set to integrated Windows authentication only.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259650r960792_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., networks, web servers, and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications (e.g., authentication servers) and other applications that perform information and system access control functions.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Exchange auto-forwarding email to remote domains must be disabled or restricted.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259651r960801_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Attackers can use automated messages to determine whether a user account is active, in the office, traveling, and so on. An attacker might use this information to conduct future attacks. Verify Automatic Forwards to remote domains are disabled, except for enterprise mail that must be restricted to forward only to .mil and .gov. domains.

### Rule: Exchange connectivity logging must be enabled.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259652r960879_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>A connectivity log is a record of the SMTP connection activity of the outbound message delivery queues to the destination Mailbox server, smart host, or domain. Connectivity logging is available on Mailbox servers in Exchange 2019 as it holds Mailbox, Client Access, and Hub Transport roles. This must also be completed on Edge Transport servers, as that is a separate role. By default, connectivity logging is disabled. If events are not recorded, it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users. Note: Transport configuration settings apply to the organization/global level of the Exchange SMTP path. By checking and setting them on the Mailbox server, the setting will apply to both Hub and Edge server roles.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Exchange email diagnostic log level must be set to the lowest level.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259653r960879_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Log files help establish a history of activities and can be useful in detecting attack attempts or determining tuning adjustments to improve availability. Diagnostic logging, however, characteristically produces large volumes of data and requires care in managing the logs to prevent risk of disk capacity denial-of-service conditions. Exchange diagnostic logging is divided into 29 main "services", each of which has anywhere from two to 26 "categories" of events to be monitored. Each category may be set to one of four levels of logging: Lowest, Low, Medium, and High, depending on how much detail is required. Higher levels of detail require more disk space to store the audit material. Diagnostic logging is intended to help administrators debug problems with their systems, not as a general-purpose auditing tool. Because the diagnostic logs collect a great amount of information, the log files may grow large very quickly. Diagnostic log levels may be raised for limited periods of time when attempting to debug relevant pieces of Exchange functionality. Once debugging has finished, diagnostic log levels should be reduced again.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The RBAC role for audit log management must be defined and restricted.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259655r960882_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>The RBAC role for the audit log management "Audit Log Role" should be defined in the Organizational or Enterprise Domain Security Plan (EDSP) to define the necessary personnel that are required to handle audit logs for the Microsoft Exchange application. Group membership should be audited regularly by checking the EDSP regularly and determine who should and should not have group membership. There are three built-in groups that automatically have membership: Organization Management, Compliance Management, and Records Management.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Group ID:** `V-259656`

### Rule: Exchange email subject line logging must be disabled.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259656r960900_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Log files help establish a history of activities and can be useful in detecting attack attempts or determining tuning adjustments to improve availability. When "message tracking" is enabled, only the sender, recipients, time, and other delivery information is included by default. Information such as the subject and message body is not included. However, the absence of the message subject line can make it difficult to locate a specific message in the log unless one knows roughly what time the message was sent. To simplify searches through these logs, Exchange offers the ability to include the message "subject line" in the log files and in the Message Tracking Center display. This can make it significantly easier to locate a specific message. However, this feature creates larger log files and will contain information that may raise privacy and legal concerns. Enterprise policy should be consulted before this feature is enabled. Also, because the log files may contain sensitive information in the form of the subject line, the log files will need to be protected, commensurate with the sensitivity level, as the content may be of interest to an attacker. For these reasons, it is recommended that subject logging not be enabled during regular production operations. Instead, treat this feature as a diagnostic that can be used if needed. The tradeoff is that finding the correct message in the message tracking logs will become more difficult because the administrator will need to search using only the time the message was sent and the message's sender. This control will have no effect unless Message Tracking is enabled. However, the setting should be disabled in case message tracking is enabled in the future.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Exchange circular logging must be disabled.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259658r960900_rule`
**Severity:** low

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Logging provides a history of events performed and can also provide evidence of tampering or attack. Failure to create and preserve logs adds to the risk that suspicious events may go unnoticed and raises the potential that insufficient history will be available to investigate them. This setting controls how log files are written. If circular logging is enabled, one log file is stored with a default size of 1024 KB. Once the size limit has been reached, additional log entries overwrite the oldest log entries. If circular logging is disabled, once a log file reaches the size limit, a new log file is created. Mailbox should not use circular logging. Logs should be written to a partition separate from the operating system, with log protection and backups being incorporated into the overall System Security Plan.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Exchange queue monitoring must be configured with threshold and action.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259659r960918_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Monitors are automated "process watchers" that respond to performance changes and can be useful in detecting outages and alerting administrators where attention is needed. Exchange has built-in monitors that enable the administrator to generate alerts if thresholds are reached, better enabling them to react in a timely fashion. This field offers choices of alerts when a "warning" or "critical" threshold is reached on the SMTP queue. A good rule of thumb (default) is to issue warnings when SMTP queue growth exceeds 10 minutes and critical messages when it exceeds 20 minutes, which should only happen occasionally. Frequent alerts against this counter may indicate a network or other issue (such as inbound ExchangeMER traffic) that directly impacts email delivery. Notification choices include email alert to an email-enabled account (for example, an email administrator) or invoke a script to take other action (for example, to add an event to the Microsoft Application Event Log, where external monitors might detect it).</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>It is detrimental for applications to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors. Applications are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Examples of nonessential capabilities include but are not limited to advertising software or browser plug-ins not related to requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission but that cannot be disabled. All system errors in Exchange will result in outbound traffic that may be identified by an eavesdropper.

**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>It is detrimental for applications to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors. Applications are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Examples of nonessential capabilities include, but are not limited to, advertising software or browser plug-ins not related to requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission but that cannot be disabled. Customer Experience reports in Exchange will result in outbound traffic that may be identified by an eavesdropper. For this reason, the Customer Experience reports must not be sent to Microsoft.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

If a Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) sender does not have a direct connection to the internet (for example, an application that produces reports to be emailed), it will need to use an SMTP Receive connector that does have a path to the internet (for example, a local email server) as a relay. SMTP relay functions must be protected so third parties are not able to hijack a relay service for their own purposes. Most commonly, hijacking of relays is done by spammers to disguise the source of their messages and may also be used to cover the source of more destructive attacks. Relays can be restricted in one of three ways: by blocking relays (restrict to a blank list of servers), by restricting use to lists of valid servers, or by restricting use to servers that can authenticate. Because authenticated connections are the most secure for SMTP Receive connectors, it is recommended that relays allow only servers that can authenticate.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Severity:** low

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Email system availability depends in part on best practice strategies for setting tuning configurations. The Global Recipient Count Limit field is used to control the maximum number of recipients that can be specified in a single message sent from this server. Its primary purpose is to minimize the chance of an internal sender spamming other recipients, since spam messages often have a large number of recipients. Spam prevention can originate from both outside and inside organizations. While inbound spam is evaluated as it arrives, controls such as this one help prevent spam that might originate inside the organization. The Recipient Count Limit is global to the Exchange implementation. Lower-level refinements are possible; however, in this configuration strategy, setting the value once at the global level facilitates a more available system by eliminating potential conflicts among multiple settings. A value of less than or equal to "5000" is probably larger than is needed for most organizations but is small enough to minimize usefulness to spammers and is easily handled by Exchange. An unexpanded distribution is handled as one recipient. Specifying "unlimited" may result in abuse.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

<VulnDiscussion>Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is the permissions model used in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019. With RBAC, there is no need to modify and manage access control lists (ACLs), which was done in Exchange Server 2007. ACLs created several challenges in Exchange 2007, such as modifying ACLs without causing unintended consequences, maintaining ACL modifications through upgrades, and troubleshooting problems that occurred due to using ACLs in a nonstandard way. RBAC enables users to control, at both broad and granular levels, what administrators and end-users can do. RBAC also enables users to more closely align the roles assigned to users and administrators to the actual roles they hold within the organization. In Exchange 2007, the server permissions model applied only to the administrators who managed the Exchange 2007 infrastructure. Starting with Exchange 2013, RBAC now controls both the administrative tasks that can be performed and the extent to which users can now administer their own mailbox and distribution groups.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Unneeded but running services offer attackers an enhanced attack profile, and attackers are constantly watching to discover open ports with running services. By analyzing and disabling unneeded services, the associated open ports become unresponsive to outside queries, and servers become more secure as a result. Exchange Server has role-based server deployment to enable protocol path control and logical separation of network traffic types. For example, a server implemented in the Client Access role (i.e., Outlook Web App [OWA]) is configured and tuned as a web server using web protocols. A client access server exposes only web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS), enabling system administrators to optimize the protocol path and disable all services unnecessary for Exchange web services. Similarly, servers created to host mailboxes are dedicated to that task and must operate only the services needed for mailbox hosting. (Exchange servers must also operate some web services, but only to the degree that Exchange requires the IIS engine in order to function). Because Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) and Internet Message Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4) clients are not included in the standard desktop offering, they must be disabled. While IMAP4 is restricted, IMAP Secure is not restricted and does not apply to this requirement.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

The use of secure communication prevents eavesdroppers from reading or modifying communications between mail clients and servers. While sensitive message bodies should be encrypted by the sender at the client, requiring a secure connection from server to server adds protection by encrypting the sender and recipient information that cannot be encrypted by the sender.

### Rule: Exchange must provide mailbox databases in a highly available and redundant configuration.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259709r961620_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Exchange Server mailbox databases and any data contained in those mailboxes should be protected. This can be accomplished by configuring Mailbox servers and databases for high availability and site resilience. A database availability group (DAG) is a component of the Mailbox server high availability and site resilience framework built into Microsoft Exchange Server 2019. A DAG is a group of Mailbox servers that hosts a set of databases and provides automatic database-level recovery from failures that affect individual servers or databases. A DAG is a boundary for mailbox database replication and database and server switchovers and failovers. Any server in a DAG can host a copy of a mailbox database from any other server in the DAG. When a server is added to a DAG, it works with the other servers in the DAG to provide automatic recovery from failures that affect mailbox databases, such as a disk, server, or network failure.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

Review the Email Domain Security Plan (EDSP). Determine if a Database Availability Group exists. From Exchange Admin Center: 1. In the pane on the left, navigate to "servers". 2. In the pane on the right, navigate to the "database availability groups" tab. 3. Verify a database availability group is configured with member servers. If two or more member servers are not listed, this is a finding. From Exchange PowerShell, run the following cmdlet: Get-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup If no DatabaseAvailabilityGroup is listed or a Database Availability Group is listed but has no member servers, this is a finding. Determine if the Exchange Mailbox databases are using redundancy. From Exchange Admin Center: 1. In the pane on the left, navigate to "servers". 2. In the pane on the right, navigate to the "databases" tab. 3. For each database, check the column "SERVERS WITH COPIES". Unless specified in the EDSP, if the "SERVERS WITH COPIES" column does not have two or more servers listed, this is a finding. From Exchange PowerShell, run the following cmdlet: Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus -Identity <DatabaseName> Unless specified in the EDSP, if the output of this cmdlet does not show more than one copy, this is a finding.

### Rule: The application must protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259710r961632_rule`
**Severity:** high

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised since unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read or altered. This requirement applies only to those applications that are either distributed or can allow access to data nonlocally. Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. When transmitting data, applications need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms, such as TLS, TLS VPNs, or IPsec. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.

### Rule: Exchange must be configured in accordance with the security configuration settings based on DOD security configuration or implementation guidance, including STIGs, NSA configuration guides, CTOs, and DTMs.

**Rule ID:** `SV-259712r961863_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Configuring Exchange to implement organization-wide security implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DOD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements. Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the application, including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>
