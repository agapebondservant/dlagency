### Rule: Rancher MCM must use a centralized user management solution to support account management functions. For accounts using password authentication, the container platform must use FIPS-validated SHA-2 or later protocol to protect the integrity of the password authentication process.

**Rule ID:** `SV-252843r986175_rule`
**Severity:** high

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>RBAC Integration and Authn/Authz Centralized authentication services provide additional functionality fulfilling security requirements: - Multi-factor authentication, which is compatible with Rancher MCM. - Disabling users after a period of time. - Storage and transmission of secure information is encrypted. - Secure authentication protocols such as LDAP over TLS, or LDAPS using FIPS 140-2 approved encryption modules. - PKI based authentication. Rancher MCM can integrate with external centralized authentication but does not offer a native solution. The authentication mechanism needs to be initially enabled and configured. The proxy authenticates users and forwards their requests to Kubernetes clusters using a service account.

### Rule: Rancher MCM must generate audit records for all DoD-defined auditable events within all components in the platform.

**Rule ID:** `SV-252844r960777_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Audit logs must be enabled. Rancher MCM provides audit record generation capabilities. Audit logs capture what happened, when it happened, who initiated it, and what cluster it affected to ensure non-repudiation of actions taken. Audit logging at the platform level also needs to be enabled. This will need to be done through the Kubernetes engine and is not always configurable through the Rancher MCM application. Audit log verbosity can be set to one of the following levels: 0 - Disable audit log (default setting). 1 - Log event metadata. 2 - Log event metadata and request body. 3 - Log event metadata, request body, and response body. Each log transaction for a request/response pair uses the same auditID value. Cluster administrators with authorized access can view logs produced by the Rancher MCM server. Audit and normal application logs generated by Rancher MCM can be forwarded to a remote log aggregation system for use by authorized viewers as well. This system can in turn be configured for further log processing, monitoring, backup, and alerting. This aggregation also should include failover and buffering in the event that a logging subsystem fails. The logging mechanism of the individual server is independent and will kill the server process if this logging mechanism fails. To meet the requirements of this control, an administrator with access to the local cluster configuration must add the 'AUDIT_LOG' environment variable with a level of at least 2 in the Rancher MCM deployment configuration. This setting will persist between restarts of the application. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000026-CTR-000070, SRG-APP-000033-CTR-000100, SRG-APP-000089-CTR-000150, SRG-APP-000090-CTR-000155, SRG-APP-000091-CTR-000160, SRG-APP-000092-CTR-000165, SRG-APP-000095-CTR-000170, SRG-APP-000096-CTR-000175, SRG-APP-000109-CTR-000215, SRG-APP-000343-CTR-000780, SRG-APP-000358-CTR-000805, SRG-APP-000374-CTR-000865, SRG-APP-000375-CTR-000870</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Rancher MCM must allocate audit record storage and generate audit records associated with events, users, and groups.

**Rule ID:** `SV-252846r960900_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Rancher logging capability and optional aggregation The Rancher server automatically logs everything at the container level. These logs are stored on the system which are then optionally picked up by further log aggregation systems. Cluster administrators with authorized access can view logs produced by the Rancher server as well as change logging settings to trigger a new deployment with the new settings. Audit and normal application logs generated by Rancher can be forwarded to a remote log aggregation system for use by authorized viewers as well. This system can in turn be configured for further log processing, monitoring, backup, and alerting. This aggregation also must include failover and buffering in the event a logging subsystem fails. The logging mechanism of the individual server is independent and will kill the server process if this logging mechanism fails. Rancher provides audit record generation capabilities. Audit logs capture what happened, when it happened, who initiated it, and what cluster it affected to ensure non-repudiation of actions taken. Audit log verbosity can be set to one of the following levels: 0 - Disable audit log (default setting). 1 - Log event metadata. 2 - Log event metadata and request body. 3 - Log event metadata, request body, and response body. Each log transaction for a request/response pair uses the same auditID value. Application logs can be set to one of the following levels: info = Logs informational messages. This is the default log level. debug = Logs more detailed messages that can be used to debug. trace = Logs very detailed messages on internal functions. This is very verbose and can contain sensitive information. Log metadata includes the following information (sample): { 'auditID': '30022177-9e2e-43d1-b0d0-06ef9d3db183', 'requestURI': '/v3/schemas', 'sourceIPs': ['::1'], 'user': { 'name': 'user-f4tt2', 'group': ['system:authenticated'] }, 'verb': 'GET', 'stage': 'RequestReceived', 'stageTimestamp': '2018-07-20 10:22:43 +0800' 'requestBody': { [redacted] } } Satisfies: SRG-APP-000098-CTR-000185, SRG-APP-000100-CTR-000195, SRG-APP-000100-CTR-000200, SRG-APP-000101-CTR-000205, SRG-APP-000181-CTR-000485, SRG-APP-000290-CTR-000670, SRG-APP-000357-CTR-000800, SRG-APP-000359-CTR-000810, SRG-APP-000360-CTR-000815, SRG-APP-000492-CTR-001220, SRG-APP-000493-CTR-001225, SRG-APP-000494-CTR-001230, SRG-APP-000495-CTR-001235, SRG-APP-000496-CTR-001240, SRG-APP-000497-CTR-001245, SRG-APP-000498-CTR-001250, SRG-APP-000499-CTR-001255, SRG-APP-000500-CTR-001260, SRG-APP-000501-CTR-001265, SRG-APP-000502-CTR-001270, SRG-APP-000503-CTR-001275, SRG-APP-000504-CTR-001280, SRG-APP-000505-CTR-001285, SRG-APP-000506-CTR-001290, SRG-APP-000507-CTR-001295, SRG-APP-000508-CTR-001300, SRG-APP-000509-CTR-001305, SRG-APP-000510-CTR-001310, SRG-APP-000516-CTR-000790</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Rancher MCM must never automatically remove or disable emergency accounts.

**Rule ID:** `SV-252847r971528_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Emergency accounts are administrator accounts that are established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability. Emergency accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency account is normally a different account that is created for use by vendors or system maintainers. To address access requirements, many application developers choose to integrate their applications with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the application developer to off-load those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality. Local Admin user should exist so that Rancher can be used if the external authentication service encounters issues.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Check Text:**
Ensure local emergency admin account has not been removed and is the only Local account. Navigate to the Triple Bar Symbol(Global) >> Users & Authentication. In the left navigation menu, click "Users". There should be only one local account and that account should have administrator role. If no local administrator account exists or there is more than one local account, this is a finding.
