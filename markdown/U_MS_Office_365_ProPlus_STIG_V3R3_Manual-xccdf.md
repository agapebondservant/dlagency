### Rule: Macros must be blocked from running in Access files from the Internet.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223280r961050_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting allows you to block macros from running in Office files that come from the Internet. If you enable this policy setting, macros are blocked from running, even if “Enable all macros” is selected in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. Also, instead of having the choice to “Enable Content”, users will receive a notification that macros are blocked from running. If the Office file is saved to a trusted location or was previously trusted by the user, macros will be allowed to run. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the settings configured in the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center determine whether macros run in Office files that come from the Internet.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Trust Bar Notifications for unsigned application add-ins in Access must be disabled and blocked.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223281r1016166_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether the specified Office application notifies users when unsigned application add-ins are loaded or silently disable such add-ins without notification. This policy setting only applies if the "Require that application add-ins are signed by Trusted Publisher" policy setting is enabled, which prevents users from changing this policy setting. If users enable this policy setting, applications automatically disable unsigned add-ins without informing users. If this policy setting is disabled, if this application is configured to require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher, any unsigned add-ins the application loads will be disabled and the application will display the Trust Bar at the top of the active window. The Trust Bar contains a message that informs users about the unsigned add-in. If users do not configure this policy setting, the disable behavior applies, and in addition, users can configure this requirement themselves in the "Add-ins" category of the Trust Center for the application.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: VBA macros not digitally signed must be blocked in Access.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223282r1082349_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls how the specified applications warn users when Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros are present. If this policy setting is enabled, choose from four options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about macros: - Disable all with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for all macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office. This option also allows users to potentially enable unsigned/untrusted macros. If a site requires the use of macros, they must be signed/approved and added to appropriate locations listed in the Trust Center Settings. - Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. - Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. - Enable all macros (not recommended): All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected. If this policy setting is disabled, "Disable all with notification" will be the default setting. If this policy setting is not configured, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking "Enable Content" on the Trust Bar. If the user clicks "Enable Content", then the document is added as a trusted document. Important: If "Disable all except digitally signed macros" is selected, users will not be able to open unsigned Access databases.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Macro Runtime Scan Scope must be enabled for all documents.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223284r961092_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting specifies for which documents the VBA Runtime Scan feature is enabled. If the feature is disabled for all documents, no runtime scanning of enabled macros will be performed. If the feature is enabled for low trust documents, the feature will be enabled for all documents for which macros are enabled except: - Documents opened while macro security settings are set to "Enable All Macros" - Documents opened from a Trusted Location - Documents that are Trusted Documents - Documents that contain VBA that is digitally signed by a Trusted Publisher If the feature is enabled for all documents, then the above class of documents are not excluded from the behavior. This protocol allows the VBA runtime to report to the Anti-Virus system certain high-risk code behaviors it is about to execute and allows the Anti-Virus to report back to the process if the sequence of observed behaviors indicates likely malicious activity so the Office application can take appropriate action. When this feature is enabled, affected VBA projects' runtime performance may be reduced.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Document metadata for rights managed Office Open XML files must be protected.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223285r1067544_rule`
**Severity:** high

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting determines whether metadata is encrypted in Office Open XML files that are protected by Information Rights Management (IRM). If this policy setting is enabled, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word encrypt metadata stored in rights-managed Office Open XML files and override any configuration changes on users' computers. If this policy setting is enabled, Office 2016 applications cannot encrypt metadata in rights-managed Office Open XML files, which can reduce security. If this policy setting is not configured when Information Rights Management (IRM) is used to restrict access to an Office Open XML document, any metadata associated with the document is not encrypted.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Rule ID:** `SV-223286r960963_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether Office 365 ProPlus applications can poll Office servers to retrieve lists of published links. If this policy setting is enabled, Office 365 ProPlus applications cannot poll an Office server for published links. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, users of Office 365 ProPlus applications can see and use links to Microsoft SharePoint Server sites from those applications. Published links can be configured to Office applications during initial deployment, and can add or change links as part of regular operations. These links appear on the My SharePoint Sites tab of the Open, Save, and Save As dialog boxes when opening and saving documents from these applications. Links can be targeted so they only appear to users who are members of particular audiences. Note: This policy setting applies to Microsoft SharePoint Server specifically. It does not apply to Microsoft SharePoint Foundation. </VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: ActiveX Controls must be initialized in Safe Mode.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223288r961779_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting specifies the Microsoft ActiveX initialization security level for all Microsoft Office applications. ActiveX controls can adversely affect a computer directly. In addition, malicious code can be used to compromise an ActiveX control and attack a computer. To indicate the safety of an ActiveX control, developers can denote them as Safe for Initialization (SFI). SFI indicates that a control is safe to open and run, and that it is not capable of causing a problem for any computer, regardless of whether it has persisted data values or not. If a control is not marked SFI, it is possible that the control could adversely affect a computer--or it could mean that the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether it might be compromised in the future. If you enable this policy setting, you can set the ActiveX security level to a number between 1 and 6. These security levels are as follows: 1. Regardless of how the control is marked, load it and use the persisted values (if any). This setting does not prompt the user. 2. If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, load in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or use the default (first-time initialization) settings. This level is similar to the default configuration, but does not prompt the user. 3. If SFI, load the control in unsafe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with default (first-time initialization) settings. 4. If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with default (first-time initialization) settings. 5. If SFI, load the control in unsafe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with persisted values. 6. If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with persisted values. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, if a control is marked SFI, the application loads the control in safe mode and uses persisted values (if any). If the control is not marked SFI, the application loads the control in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or uses the default (first-time initialization) settings. In both situations, the Message Bar informs users that the controls have been disabled and prompts them to respond. Important: Some ActiveX controls do not respect the safe mode registry setting, and therefore might load persisted data even though you configure this setting to instruct the control to use safe mode. This setting only increases security for ActiveX controls that are accurately marked as SFI. In situations that involve malicious or poorly designed code, an ActiveX control might be inaccurately marked as SFI.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Rule ID:** `SV-223289r961092_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether macros can run in an Office 365 ProPlus application that is opened programmatically by another application. If this policy setting is enabled, the user can choose from three options for controlling macro behavior in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word when the application is opened programmatically: - Disable macros by default ¬- all macros are disabled in the programmatically opened application. - Macros enabled (default) - macros can run in the programmatically opened application. This option enforces the default configuration in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. - User application macro security level - macro functionality is determined by the setting in the "Macro Settings" section of the Trust Center. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, when a separate program is used to launch Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, or Word programmatically, any macros can run in the programmatically opened application without being blocked.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Rule ID:** `SV-223290r1016167_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether Office 365 ProPlus applications notify users when potentially unsafe features or content are detected, or whether such features or content are silently disabled without notification. The Message Bar in Office 365 ProPlus applications is used to identify security issues, such as unsigned macros or potentially unsafe add-ins. When such issues are detected, the application disables the unsafe feature or content and displays the Message Bar at the top of the active window. The Message Bar informs the users about the nature of the security issue and, in some cases, provides the users with an option to enable the potentially unsafe feature or content, which could harm the user's computer. If this policy setting is enabled, Office 365 ProPlus applications do not display information in the Message Bar about potentially unsafe content that has been detected or has automatically been blocked.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting enables you to specify an encryption type for password-protected Office 97-2003 files. If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the type of encryption that Office applications will use to encrypt password-protected files in the older Office 97-2003 file formats. The chosen encryption type must have a corresponding cryptographic service provider (CSP) installed on the computer that encrypts the file. See the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults\Provider\ registry key for a list of CSPs installed on the local computer. Specify the encryption type to use by entering it in the provided text box in the following form: <Encryption Provider>,<Encryption Algorithm>,<Encryption Key Length>. For example, Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0,RC4,128 If you do not configure this policy setting, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word use Office 97/2000 Compatible encryption, a proprietary encryption method, to encrypt password-protected Office 97-2003 files.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The load of controls in Forms3 must be blocked.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223295r961086_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting allows the user to control how ActiveX controls in UserForms should be initialized based upon whether they are Safe for Initialization (SFI) or Unsafe for Initialization (UFI). ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects and have unrestricted access to users' computers. ActiveX controls can access the local file system and change the registry settings of the operating system. If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant. To help improve security, ActiveX developers can mark controls as SFI, which means that the developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and not capable of causing harm to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a computer, or the developers may not have tested the control in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date. SFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in very powerful ways when safety was not important, but the control would still be safe for use in a Web page. If a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked UFI, which means that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded, they are always loaded in unsafe mode. If this policy setting is enabled, choose from four options for loading controls in UserForms: 1. For a UFI or SFI signed control that supports safe and unsafe mode, load the control in unsafe mode. For an SFI signed control that only supports a safe mode configuration, load the control in safe mode. This option enforces the default configuration. 2. Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI: - For a UFI signed control, if users respond "Yes" to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond "No", load the control using the default properties. - For an SFI signed control that supports both safe and unsafe modes, if users respond "Yes" to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond "No", load the control using safe mode. If the SFI control can only support safe mode, load the control in safe mode. This option is the default configuration in the Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus release. 3. Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI: - For a UFI signed control, if users respond "Yes" to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond "No", load the control with its default properties. - For an SFI signed control, load in safe mode. 4. For a UFI signed control, load with the default properties of the control.

**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether Office 365 ProPlus applications notify users when potentially unsafe features or content are detected, or whether such features or content are silently disabled without notification. The Message Bar in Office 2016 applications is used to identify security issues, such as unsigned macros or potentially unsafe add-ins. When such issues are detected, the application disables the unsafe feature or content and displays the Message Bar at the top of the active window. The Message Bar informs the users about the nature of the security issue and, in some cases, provides the users with an option to enable the potentially unsafe feature or content, which could harm the user's computer. If you enable this policy setting, Office 365 ProPlus applications do not display information in the Message Bar about potentially unsafe content that has been detected or has automatically been blocked. If you disable this policy setting, Office 365 ProPlus applications display information in the Message Bar about content that has automatically been blocked. If you do not configure this policy setting, if an Office 365 ProPlus application detects a security issue, the Message Bar is displayed. However, this configuration can be modified by users in the Trust Center.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether the Adobe Flash control can be activated by Office documents. Note that activation blocking applies only within Office processes.

"Block all activation" prevents the Flash control from being loaded, whether directly referenced by the document or indirectly by another embedded object. 2. "Block embedding/linking, allow other activation" prevents the Flash control from being loaded when directly referenced by the document, but does not prevent activation through another object. 3. "Allow all activation" restores Office's default behavior, allowing the Flash control to be activated. Because this setting is not a true Group Policy setting and "tattoos" the registry, enabling the "Allow all activation" option is the only way to restore default behavior after either of the "Block" options has been applied.

### Rule: Trusted Locations on the network must be disabled in Excel.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223310r961092_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether trusted locations on the network can be used. If you enable this policy setting, users can specify trusted locations on network shares or in other remote locations that are not under their direct control by selecting the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the selected application ignores any network locations listed in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. Disabling this policy setting does not delete any network locations from the Trusted Locations list. Instead, it forces the selected application to treat the locations as non-trusted and prevents users from adding new network locations to the list. If you also deploy Trusted Locations via Group Policy, you should verify whether any of them are remote locations. If any of them are remote locations and you do not allow remote locations via this policy setting, those policy keys that point to remote locations will be ignored on client computers. Disabling this policy setting will cause disruption for users who add network locations to the Trusted Locations list. However, it is not recommended to enable this policy setting (as the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box itself states), so in practice it should be possible to disable this policy setting in most situations without causing significant usability issues for most users.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. - Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. - Enable all macros (not recommended): All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned.

**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting allows administrators to disable the AutoRepublish feature in Excel. If users choose to publish Excel data to a static Web page and enable the AutoRepublish feature, Excel saves a copy of the data to the Web page every time the user saves the workbook. By default, a message dialog displays every time the user saves a published workbook when AutoRepublish is enabled. From this dialog, the user can disable AutoRepublish temporarily or permanently, or select "Do not show this message again" to prevent the dialog from appearing after every save. If the user selects "Do not show this message again", Excel will continue to automatically republish the data after every save without informing the user. If you enable this policy setting, the AutoRepublish feature is turned off and Excel users will need to publish data to the Web manually. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can enable the AutoRepublish feature to automatically republish workbooks saved as type Web Page.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: File extensions must be enabled to match file types in Excel.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223332r961863_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls how Excel loads file types that do not match their extension. Excel can load files with extensions that do not match the files' type. For example, if a comma-separated values (CSV) file named example.csv is renamed example.xls (or any other file extension supported by Excel 2003 and earlier only), Excel can properly load it as a CSV file. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three options for working with files that have non-matching extensions: - Allow different - Excel opens the files properly without warning users that the files have non-matching extensions. If users subsequently edit and save the files, Excel preserves both the true, underlying file format and the incorrect file extension. - Allow different, but warn - Excel opens the files properly, but warns users about the file type mismatch. This option is the default configuration in Excel. - Always match file type - Excel does not open any files that have non-matching extensions. If this policy setting is disabled or not configured or if users attempt to open files with the wrong extension, Excel opens the file and displays a warning that the file type is not what Excel expected.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about WEBSERVICE functions: - Disable all with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for all WEBSERVICE functions.

This option can significantly reduce security by allowing information disclosure to third-party web services. If you disable this policy setting, the “Disable all with notification” will be the default setting. If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open workbooks that contain WEBSERVICE functions, Excel will open the files with the WEBSERVICE functions disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that WEBSERVICE functions are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking "Enable Content" on the Trust Bar.

**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls the Junk E-mail protection level. The Junk E-mail Filter in Outlook helps to prevent junk email messages, also known as spam, from cluttering a user's Inbox. The filter evaluates each incoming message based on several factors, including the time when the message was sent and the content of the message. The filter does not single out any particular sender or message type, but instead analyzes each message based on its content and structure to determine if it is likely spam. A Junk E-mail filtering option of "No Automatic Filtering" will evaluate emails against domain names and email addresses in the blocked sender list and send them to the Junk E-mail folder. A Junk E-mail filtering option of "High" is not recommended when behind enterprise-level capabilities such as Enterprise Email Security Gateway (EEMSG), Cloud-Based Internet Isolation (CBII), and O365 Exchange Online Protection (EOP).</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Security Level for macros in Outlook must be configured to Warn for signed and disable unsigned.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223373r961086_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls the security level for macros in Outlook. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for handling macros in Outlook: - Always warn. This option corresponds to the "Warnings for all macros" option in the "Macro Security" section of the Outlook Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from a trusted location, even if the macros are signed by a trusted publisher. For each disabled macro, Outlook displays a security alert dialog box with information about the macro and its digital signature (if present), and allows users to enable the macro or leave it disabled. - Never warn, disable all. This option corresponds to the "No warnings and disable all macros" option in the Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from trusted locations, and does not notify users. - Warning for signed, disable unsigned. This option corresponds to the "Warnings for signed macros; all unsigned macros are disabled" option in the Trust Center. Outlook handles macros as follows: --If a macro is digitally signed by a trusted publisher, the macro can run if the user has already trusted the publisher. --If a macro has a valid signature from a publisher that the user has not trusted, the security alert dialog box for the macro lets the user choose whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for the current session, or to add the publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so that it will run without prompting the user in the future. --If a macro does not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without prompting the user, unless it is opened from a trusted location. This option is the default configuration in Outlook. - No security check. This option corresponds to the "No security check for macros (Not recommended)" option in the Trust Center. Outlook runs all macros without prompting users. This configuration makes users' computers vulnerable to potentially malicious code and is not recommended. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of Enabled -- Warning for signed, disable unsigned.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Trusted Locations on the network must be disabled in Project.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223374r961092_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether trusted locations on the network can be used. If you enable this policy setting, users can specify trusted locations on network shares or in other remote locations that are not under their direct control by clicking the "Add new location" button in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission. If you disable this policy setting, the selected application ignores any network locations listed in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. If you also deploy Trusted Locations via Group Policy, you should verify whether any of them are remote locations. If any of them are remote locations and you do not allow remote locations via this policy setting, those policy keys that point to remote locations will be ignored on client computers. Disabling this policy setting does not delete any network locations from the Trusted Locations list, but causes disruption for users who add network locations to the Trusted Locations list. Users are also prevented from adding new network locations to the Trusted Locations list in the Trust Center. We recommended that you do not enable this policy setting as the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box also states. Therefore, in practice, it should be possible to disable this policy setting in most situations without causing significant usability issues for most users. If you do not enable this policy setting, users can select the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box if desired and then specify trusted locations by clicking the "Add new location" button.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls how the specified applications warn users when Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros are present. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about macros: - Disable all with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for all macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office. This option also allows users to potentially enable unsigned/untrusted macros. If a site requires the use of macros, they must be signed /approved and added to appropriate locations listed in the Trust Center Settings. - Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. - Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. - Enable all macros (not recommended): All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected. If you disable this policy setting, "Disable all with notification" will be the default setting. If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking "Enable Content" on the Trust Bar. If the user clicks "Enable Content", then the document is added as a trusted document.

### Rule: Unsigned add-ins in PowerPoint must be blocked with no Trust Bar Notification to the user.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223384r1016170_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether the specified Office application notifies users when unsigned application add-ins are loaded or silently disable such add-ins without notification. This policy setting only applies if the "Require that application add-ins are signed by Trusted Publisher" policy setting is enabled, which prevents users from changing this policy setting. If this policy setting is enabled, applications automatically disable unsigned add-ins without informing users. If this policy setting is disabled, if this application is configured to require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher, any unsigned add-ins the application loads will be disabled and the application will display the Trust Bar at the top of the active window. The Trust Bar contains a message that informs users about the unsigned add-in. If this policy setting is not configured, the disable behavior applies, and in addition, users can configure this requirement themselves in the "Add-ins" category of the Trust Center for the application.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The use of network locations must be ignored in PowerPoint.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223389r961092_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether trusted locations on the network can be used. If you enable this policy setting, users can specify trusted locations on network shares or in other remote locations that are not under their direct control by clicking the "Add new location" button in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission. If you disable this policy setting, the selected application ignores any network locations listed in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. If you also deploy Trusted Locations via Group Policy, you should verify whether any of them are remote locations. If any of them are remote locations and you do not allow remote locations via this policy setting, those policy keys that point to remote locations will be ignored on client computers. Disabling this policy setting does not delete any network locations from the Trusted Locations list, but causes disruption for users who add network locations to the Trusted Locations list. Users are also prevented from adding new network locations to the Trusted Locations list in the Trust Center. It is recommended that you do not enable this policy setting, as the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended) check box also states. Therefore, in practice, it should be possible to disable this policy setting in most situations without causing significant usability issues for most users. If you do not enable this policy setting, users can select the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box if desired and then specify trusted locations by clicking the "Add new location" button.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Publisher must disable all unsigned VBA macros.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223392r1016172_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls how the specified applications warn users when Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros are present. If this policy setting is enabled, users can choose from four options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about macros: - Disable all with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for all macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office. This option also allows users to potentially enable unsigned/untrusted macros. If a site requires the use of macros, they must be signed/approved and added to appropriate locations listed in the Trust Center Settings. - Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. - Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. - Enable all macros (not recommended): All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected. If this policy setting is disabled, "Disable all with notification" will be the default setting. If this policy setting is not configured, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking "Enable Content" on the Trust Bar. If the user clicks "Enable Content", then the document is added as a trusted document. Important: If "Disable all except digitally signed macros" is selected, users will not be able to open unsigned Access databases.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Word must automatically disable unsigned add-ins without informing users.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223400r1016174_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether the specified Office application notifies users when unsigned application add-ins are loaded or silently disable such add-ins without notification. This policy setting only applies if the "Require that application add-ins are signed by Trusted Publisher" policy setting is enabled, which prevents users from changing this policy setting. If this policy setting is enabled, applications automatically disable unsigned add-ins without informing users. If this policy setting is disabled, if this application is configured to require that all add-ins be signed by a trusted publisher, any unsigned add-ins the application loads will be disabled and the application will display the Trust Bar at the top of the active window. The Trust Bar contains a message that informs users about the unsigned add-in. If this policy setting is not configured, the disable behavior applies, and in addition, users can configure this requirement themselves in the "Add-ins" category of the Trust Center for the application.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: Trusted Locations on the network must be disabled in Word.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223416r961092_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls whether trusted locations on the network can be used. If you enable this policy setting, users can specify trusted locations on network shares or in other remote locations that are not under their direct control by clicking the "Add new location" button in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. Content, code, and add-ins are allowed to load from trusted locations with minimal security and without prompting the user for permission. If you disable this policy setting, the selected application ignores any network locations listed in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center. If you also deploy Trusted Locations via Group Policy, you should verify whether any of them are remote locations. If any of them are remote locations and you do not allow remote locations via this policy setting, those policy keys that point to remote locations will be ignored on client computers. Disabling this policy setting does not delete any network locations from the Trusted Locations list, but causes disruption for users who add network locations to the Trusted Locations list. Users are also prevented from adding new network locations to the Trusted Locations list in the Trust Center. We recommended that you do not enable this policy setting as the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box also states. Therefore, in practice, it should be possible to disable this policy setting in most situations without causing significant usability issues for most users. If you do not enable this policy setting, users can select the "Allow Trusted Locations on my network (not recommended)" check box if desired and then specify trusted locations by clicking the "Add new location" button.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Group ID:** `V-223417`

### Rule: VBA Macros not digitally signed must be blocked in Word.

**Rule ID:** `SV-223417r960963_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This policy setting controls how the specified applications warn users when Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros are present. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about macros: - Disable all with notification: The application displays the Trust Bar for all macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office. This option also allows users to potentially enable unsigned/untrusted macros. If a site requires the use of macros, they must be signed /approved and added to appropriate locations listed in the Trust Center Settings. - Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. - Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. - Enable all macros (not recommended): All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

Use the Windows Registry Editor to navigate to the following key: HKCU\software\policies\Microsoft\office\16.0\word\security If the value vbawarnings is REG_DWORD = 3, this is not a finding. A value of REG_DWORD = 4 is also acceptable. If the registry key does not exist or is not configured properly, this is a finding.
