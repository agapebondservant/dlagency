## Group: PP-BYO-000020

**Group ID:** `V-257085`

### Rule: The EMM system supporting the iOS/iPadOS 16 BYOAD must be configured for autonomous monitoring, compliance, and validation to ensure security/configuration settings of mobile devices do not deviate from the approved configuration baseline.

**Rule ID:** `SV-257085r959010_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>DOD policy requires BYOAD devices with DOD data be managed by a DOD MDM server, MAM server, or VMI system. This ensures the device can be monitored for compliance with the approved security baseline and managed data and apps can be removed when the device is out of compliance, which protects DOD data from unauthorized exposure. Examples of possible EMM security controls are as follows: 1. Device access restrictions: Restrict or isolate access based on the device's access type (i.e., from the internet), authentication type (e.g., password), credential strength, etc. 2. User and device activity monitoring: Configured to detect anomalous activity, malicious activity, and unauthorized attempts to access DOD information. 3. Device health tracking: Monitor device attestation, health, and agents reporting compromised applications, connections, intrusions, and/or signatures. Reference: DOD policy "Use of Non-Government Mobile Devices". 3.a.(3)ii, 3.b.(2)ii,1 and 2.

**Group ID:** `V-257087`

### Rule: The EMM system supporting the iOS/iPadOS 16 BYOAD must be configured to detect if the BYOAD native security controls are disabled.

**Rule ID:** `SV-257087r959010_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Examples of indicators that the device native security controls have been disabled include jailbroken or rooted devices. DOD policy requires BYOAD devices with DOD data be managed by a DOD MDM server, MAM server, or VMI system. This ensures the device can be monitored for compliance with the approved security baseline and the work profile can be removed when the device is out of compliance, which protects DOD data from unauthorized exposure. Detection via collection and analysis of BYOAD-generated logs for noncompliance indicators is acceptable. This detection capability must be implemented prior to BYOAD access to DOD information and IT resources and continuously monitored on the DOD-managed segment of the BYOAD enrolled in the program. If non-DOD information (i.e., personal user data, device information) outside the DOD-managed segment of the BYOAD is required to be accessed, collected, monitored, tracked (i.e., location), or maintained, the circumstances under which this may be done must be outlined in the user agreement.

**Group ID:** `V-257103`

### Rule: The iOS/iPadOS 16 BYOAD must be configured to disable device cameras and/or microphones when brought into DOD facilities where mobile phone cameras and/or microphones are prohibited.

**Rule ID:** `SV-257103r958480_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>In some DOD operational environments, the use of the mobile device camera or microphone could lead to a security incident or compromise of DOD information. The system administrator must have the capability to disable the mobile device camera and/or microphone based on mission needs. Alternatively, mobile devices with cameras or microphones that cannot be disabled must be prohibited from the facility by the information system security officer (ISSO)/information system security manager (ISSM). If BYOAD devices are brought into facilities where the authorizing official (AO) has determined the risk of using mobile device cameras or microphones is unacceptable, this could lead to the exposure of sensitive DOD data.
