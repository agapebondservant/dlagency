### Rule: The Cisco ISE must limit the number of CLI and GUI sessions to an organization-defined number.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242607r1025177_rule`
**Severity:** low

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Device management includes the ability to control the number of management sessions that manage a device. Limiting the number of allowed sessions is helpful in limiting risks related to DoS attacks. This requirement addresses concurrent sessions for administrative access. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined based upon mission needs and the operational environment for each system. At a minimum, limits must be set for SSH and HTTPS sessions.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Check Text:**
From the web Admin portal: 1. Choose Administration >> System >>Admin Access >> Settings >> Access. 2. Verify the "Maximum Concurrent Sessions" under "GUI" Sessions is set to the organization-defined number. 3. Verify the "Maximum Concurrent Sessions" under "CLI" Sessions is set to one (recommended) or an organization-defined number. It is highly recommended the number be minimized to one or two, but this can be based on operational needs. If the CLI and GUI are not set to limit the maximum number of sessions, this is a finding.

**Group ID:** `V-242608`

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must change the password for the local CLI and web-based account when members who have access to the password leave the role and are no longer authorized access.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242608r1018744_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>If shared/group account credentials are not terminated when individuals leave the group, the user that left the group can still gain access even though they are no longer authorized. There may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the network device without unique administrator identification or authentication. A shared/group account credential is a shared form of authentication that allows multiple individuals to access the network device using a single account. Cisco ISE introduces a Generate Password option on the user and administrator creation page to generate instant password adhering to Cisco ISE password policies. This helps the users or administrators to use the password generated by Cisco ISE than spending time in thinking of a safe password to be configured.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Check Text:**
Verify by viewing site SSP to view that there is a procedure that requires password change with administrators leave the group. If Cisco ISE does not change the password for the local CLI and web-based account when members who have access to the password leave the role and are no longer authorized access, this is a finding.

## Group: SRG-APP-000026-NDM-000208

**Group ID:** `V-242609`

### Rule: For the local web-based account of last resort, the Cisco ISE must automatically audit account creation.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242609r960777_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Upon gaining access to a network device, an attacker will often first attempt to create a persistent method of reestablishing access. One way to accomplish this is to create a new account. Notification of account creation helps to mitigate this risk. Auditing account creation provides the necessary reconciliation that account management procedures are being followed. Without this audit trail, personnel without the proper authorization may gain access to critical network nodes.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: For the local web-based account of last resort and the default local CLI account, the Cisco ISE must automatically audit account modification.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242610r960780_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Since the accounts in the network device are privileged or system-level accounts, account management is vital to the security of the network device. Account management by a designated authority ensures access to the network device is being controlled in a secure manner by granting access to only authorized personnel with the appropriate and necessary privileges. Auditing account modification along with an automatic notification to appropriate individuals will provide the necessary reconciliation that account management procedures are being followed. If modifications to management accounts are not audited, reconciliation of account management procedures cannot be tracked.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

## Group: SRG-APP-000319-NDM-000283

**Group ID:** `V-242613`

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must automatically audit account enabling actions.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242613r961290_rule`
**Severity:** low

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Once an attacker establishes initial access to a system, the attacker often attempts to create a persistent method of reestablishing access. One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to simply enable a new or disabled account. Notification of account enabling is one method for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive account management process will ensure an audit trail which documents the creation of application user accounts and notifies administrators and ISSO. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

## Group: SRG-APP-000148-NDM-000346

**Group ID:** `V-242614`

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must be configured with only one local web-based account to be used as the account of last resort in the event the authentication server is unavailable.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242614r960969_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Authentication for administrative (privileged level) access to the device is required at all times. An account can be created on the device's local database for use when the authentication server is down or connectivity between the device and the authentication server is not operable. This account is referred to as the account of last resort since it is intended to be used as a last resort and when immediate administrative access is absolutely necessary. The account of last resort logon credentials must be stored in a sealed envelope and kept in a safe. The safe must be periodically audited to verify the envelope remains sealed. The signature of the auditor and the date of the audit should be added to the envelope as a record. Administrators should secure the credentials and disable the root account (if possible) when not needed for system administration functions. Accounts necessary for authorized system functions are permitted, but must be secured to prevent use for local login and remote exploitation. These accounts should either be disabled for login for non-system functions and/or use a compliant authenticator (Example RSA SecureID token).</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242615r961353_rule`
**Severity:** high

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges. Privileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

## Group: SRG-APP-000343-NDM-000289

**Group ID:** `V-242616`

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must audit the execution of privileged functions.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242616r961362_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Group ID:** `V-242617`

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must be configured to enforce the limit of three consecutive invalid logon attempts, after which time it must lock out the user account from accessing the device for 15 minutes.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242617r960840_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>By limiting the number of failed login attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced. If the administrator enters an incorrect password three times, the Admin portal locks the account, adds a log entry in the Server Administrator Logins report, and suspends the credentials until it is reset.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must protect against an individual (or process acting on behalf of an individual) falsely denying having performed organization-defined actions to be covered by non-repudiation.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242619r960864_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This requirement supports non-repudiation of actions taken by an administrator and is required in order to maintain the integrity of the configuration management process. All configuration changes to the network device are logged, and administrators authenticate with two-factor authentication before gaining administrative access. Together, these processes will ensure the administrators can be held accountable for the configuration changes they implement. To meet this requirement, the network device must log administrator access and activity.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

<VulnDiscussion>It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without an alert, security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability and system operation may be adversely affected. Cisco ISE provides system alarms which notify the administrator when critical system condition occurs. Alarms are displayed in the Alarm dashlet. Administrators can configured the dashlet to receive notification of alarms through e-mail and/or syslog messages.

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must be configured to synchronize internal information system clocks using redundant authoritative time sources.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242629r1018745_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>The loss of connectivity to a particular authoritative time source will result in the loss of time synchronization (free-run mode) and increasingly inaccurate time stamps on audit events and other functions. Multiple time sources provide redundancy by including a secondary source. Time synchronization is usually a hierarchy; clients synchronize time to a local source while that source synchronizes its time to a more accurate source. The network device must utilize an authoritative time server and/or be configured to use redundant authoritative time sources. This requirement is related to the comparison done in CCI-001891. DOD-approved solutions consist of a combination of a primary and secondary time source using a combination or multiple instances of the following: a time server designated for the appropriate DOD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet); United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers; and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS). The secondary time source must be located in a different geographic region than the primary time source.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Rule ID:** `SV-242632r961863_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Changes to the hardware or software components of the network device can have significant effects on the overall security of the network. Therefore, only qualified and authorized individuals should be allowed administrative access to the network device for implementing any changes or upgrades. This requirement applies to updates of the application files, configuration, ACLs, and policy filters. RBAC policies determine if an administrator can be granted a specific type of access to a menu item or other identity group data elements. You can grant or deny access to a menu item or identity group data element to an administrator based on the admin group, by using RBAC policies. When administrators log in to the Admin portal, they can access menus and data that are based on the policies and permissions defined for the admin groups with which they are associated. RBAC policies map admin groups to menu access and data access permissions. For example, you can prevent Access operations menu and the policy data elements. This can be achieved by creating a custom RBAC policy for the admin group with which that network administrator is associated.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must be configured to use an external authentication server to authenticate administrators prior to granting administrative access.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242633r997485_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Centralized management of authentication settings increases the security of remote and nonlocal access methods. This control is particularly important protection against the insider threat. With robust centralized management, audit records for administrator account access to the organization's network devices can be more readily analyzed for trends and anomalies. The alternative method of defining administrator accounts on each device exposes the device configuration to remote access authentication attacks and system administrators with multiple authenticators for each network device. Cisco ISE can connect with external identity sources such as Active Directory, LDAP, RADIUS Token, and RSA SecurID servers to obtain user information for authentication and authorization. External identity sources also include certificate authentication profiles needed for certificate-based authentications. Configure external authentication to a central AAA identity source. For accounts defined in the external identity, create a password policy for the external administrator account stores. Then apply this policy to the external administrator groups that eventually become a part of the external administrator RBAC policy. In addition to providing authentication via an external identity store, the network may also require the use of a Common Access Card (CAC) authentication device. To configure external authentication: - Configure password-based authentication using an external identity store. - Create an external administrator group. - Configure menu access and data access permissions for the external administrator group. - Create an RBAC policy for external administrator authentication.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Rule ID:** `SV-242652r961521_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Some authentication implementations can be configured to use cached authenticators. If cached authentication information is out-of-date, the validity of the authentication information may be questionable. The organization-defined time period should be established for each device depending on the nature of the device; for example, a device with just a few administrators in a facility with spotty network connectivity may merit a longer caching time period than a device with many administrators.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must use FIPS-validated SHA-2 (or greater) to protect the integrity of hash message authentication code (HMAC), Key Derivation Functions (KDFs), Random Bit Generation, and hash-only applications.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242653r961050_rule`
**Severity:** high

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection. Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are activities conducted by individuals communicating through either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Note: Although allowed by SP800-131Ar1 for some applications, SHA-1 is considered a compromised hashing standard and is being phased out of use by industry and government standards. Unless required for legacy use, DoD systems should not be configured to use SHA-1 for integrity of remote access sessions. To protect the integrity of the authenticator and authentication mechanism used for the cryptographic module used by the network device, the application, operating system, or protocol must be configured to use one of the following hash functions for hashing the password or other authenticator in accordance with SP 800-131Ar1: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512. Applications also include HMAC, KDFs, Random Bit Generation, and hash-only applications (e.g., hashing passwords and use for compute a checksum). For digital signature verification, SP800-131Ar1 allows SHA-1 for legacy use only, but this is discouraged by DoD. Separate requirements for configuring applications and protocols used by each product (e.g., SNMPv3, SSH, NTP, and other protocols and applications that require server/client authentication) are required to implement this requirement.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must use FIPS-validated Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) to protect the integrity of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242654r961554_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be compromised. Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Currently, HMAC is the only FIPS-approved algorithm for generating and verifying message/data authentication codes in accordance with FIPS 198-1. Products that are FIPS 140-2 validated will have an HMAC that meets specification; however, the option must be configured for use as the only message authentication code used for authentication to cryptographic modules. Separate requirements for configuring applications and protocols used by each application (e.g., SNMPv3, SSHv2, NTP, HTTPS, and other protocols and applications that require server/client authentication) are required to implement this requirement. Where SSH is used, the SSHv2 protocol suite is required because it includes Layer 7 protocols such as SCP and SFTP, which can be used for secure file transfers.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This requires the use of secure protocols instead of their unsecured counterparts, such as SSH instead of telnet, SCP instead of FTP, and HTTPS instead of HTTP. If unsecured protocols (lacking cryptographic mechanisms) are used for sessions, the contents of those sessions will be susceptible to eavesdropping, potentially putting sensitive data (including administrator passwords) at risk of compromise and potentially allowing hijacking of maintenance sessions.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must generate unique session identifiers using a FIPS 140-2 approved Random Number Generator (RNG) using DRGB.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242658r961119_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Sequentially generated session IDs can be easily guessed by an attacker. Employing the concept of randomness in the generation of unique session identifiers helps to protect against brute-force attacks to determine future session identifiers. Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attacker is unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions. SP 800-131A makes clear that RNGs specified in FIPS 186-2, ANS X9.31-1998 and ANS X9.62-1998 will be disallowed after 2015. Only SP 800-90A based random number generators will continue to be approved. NIST SP 800-90A- Recommendation for Random Number Generation using Deterministic Random Bit Generators was published in January 2012. This requirement is applicable to devices that use a web interface for device management.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must only allow authorized administrators to view or change the device configuration, system files, and other files stored.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242659r961128_rule`
**Severity:** high

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>This requirement is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity of system information at rest (e.g., network device rule sets) when it is located on a storage device within the network device or as a component of the network device. This protection is required to prevent unauthorized alteration, corruption, or disclosure of information when not stored directly on the network device. Access to device configuration, system files, and other files stored locally are restricted to administrators by design. Admin accounts must be part of an administrator group and the group has associated authorizations based on role. There are 12 pre-defined admin roles and additional groups may be added. By default, the username for a CLI admin user is admin, and the password is defined during setup. There is no default password. This CLI admin user is the default admin user, and this user account cannot be deleted. Create web administrator account as the Account of Last Resort and add to the default Super Admin group. This will allow at least one user to be able to delete other admins and perform special functions via the web management tool.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The Cisco ISE must configure the control plane to protect against or limit the effects of common types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the device itself by configuring applicable system options and internet-options.

**Rule ID:** `SV-242660r1025184_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity. This requirement addresses the configuration of network devices to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on device availability. For each network device, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or restricting the number of sessions the device opens at one time). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks. The security safeguards cannot be defined at the DOD-level because they vary according to the capabilities of the individual network devices and the security controls applied on the adjacent networks (for example, firewalls performing packet filtering to block DoS attacks).</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit information to only that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. The additional information required is dependent on the type of information (i.e., sensitivity of the data and the environment within which it resides). At a minimum, the organization must audit full-text recording of privileged commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>
