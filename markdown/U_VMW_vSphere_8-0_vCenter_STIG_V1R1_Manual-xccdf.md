**Group ID:** `V-258906`

### Rule: The vCenter Server must display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before logon.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258906r934376_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Display of the DOD-approved use notification before granting access to the application ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. System use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist. The banner must be formatted in accordance with DTM-08-060. Use the following verbiage for applications that can accommodate banners of 1300 characters: "You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions: -The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations. -At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS. -Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose. -This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy. -Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details." Use the following verbiage for operating systems that have severe limitations on the number of characters that can be displayed in the banner: "I've read (literal ampersand) consent to terms in IS user agreem't."

If the "config.log.level" value is not set to "info" or does not exist, this is a finding.

## Group: SRG-APP-000141

**Group ID:** `V-258908`

### Rule: vCenter Server plugins must be verified.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258908r934382_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>The vCenter Server includes a vSphere Client extensibility framework, which provides the ability to extend the vSphere Client with menu selections or toolbar icons that provide access to vCenter Server add-on components or external, web-based functionality. vSphere Client plugins or extensions run at the same privilege level as the user. Malicious extensions might masquerade as useful add-ons while compromising the system by stealing credentials or incorrectly configuring the system. Additionally, vCenter comes with a number of plugins preinstalled that may or may not be necessary for proper operation.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Check Text:**
From the vSphere Client, go to Administration >> Solutions >> Client Plug-Ins. View the Installed/Available Plug-ins list and verify they are all identified as authorized VMware, third-party (partner), and/or site-specific approved plug-ins. If any installed/available plug-ins in the viewable list cannot be verified as allowed vSphere Client plug-ins from trusted sources or are not in active use, this is a finding.

## Group: SRG-APP-000148

**Group ID:** `V-258909`

### Rule: The vCenter Server must uniquely identify and authenticate users or processes acting on behalf of users.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258909r934385_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>To ensure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, organizational users must be identified and authenticated to prevent potential misuse and compromise of the system. Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors). Organizational users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) must be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses except the following. (i) Accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization. Organizations document specific user actions that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication; and (ii) Accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Using Active Directory or an identity provider for authentication provides more robust account management capabilities and accountability. Satisfies: SRG-APP-000148, SRG-APP-000153, SRG-APP-000163, SRG-APP-000180, SRG-APP-000234</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Check Text:**
From the vSphere Web Client, go to Administration >> Single Sign On >> Configuration >> Identity Provider. If the identity provider type is "embedded" and there is no identity source of type "Active Directory" (either Windows Integrated Authentication or LDAP), this is a finding. If the identity provider type is "Microsoft ADFS" or another supported identity provider, this is NOT a finding.

## Group: SRG-APP-000080

**Group ID:** `V-258910`

### Rule: The vCenter Server must require multifactor authentication.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258910r934388_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to privileged functions is greatly increased. Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication. Factors include: (i) something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN); (ii) something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something a user is (e.g., biometric). Satisfies: SRG-APP-000080, SRG-APP-000149, SRG-APP-000150, SRG-APP-000391, SRG-APP-000402</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Check Text:**
From the vSphere Web Client, go to Administration >> Single Sign On >> Configuration >> Identity Provider. If the embedded identity provider is used, click on "Smart Card Authentication". If the embedded identity provider is used and "Smart Card Authentication" is not enabled, this is a finding. If a third-party identity provider is used, such as Microsoft ADFS, and it does not require multifactor authentication to log on to vCenter, this is a finding.

## Group: SRG-APP-000164

**Group ID:** `V-258911`

### Rule: The vCenter Server passwords must be at least 15 characters in length.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258911r934391_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised. Use of more characters in a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The vCenter Server must prohibit password reuse for a minimum of five generations.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258912r934394_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. To meet password policy requirements, passwords must be changed at specific policy-based intervals. If the information system or application allows the user to consecutively reuse their password when that password has exceeded its defined lifetime, the result is a password that is not changed per policy requirements.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Group ID:** `V-258917`

### Rule: The vCenter Server must enable FIPS-validated cryptography.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258917r934409_rule`
**Severity:** high

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules use authentication that meets DOD requirements. In vSphere 6.7 and later, ESXi and vCenter Server use FIPS-validated cryptography to protect management interfaces and the VMware Certificate Authority (VMCA). vSphere 7.0 Update 2 and later adds additional FIPS-validated cryptography to vCenter Server Appliance. By default, this FIPS validation option is disabled and must be enabled.

## Group: SRG-APP-000174

**Group ID:** `V-258918`

### Rule: The vCenter Server must enforce a 90-day maximum password lifetime restriction.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258918r934412_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords must be changed at specific intervals. One method of minimizing this risk is to use complex passwords and periodically change them. If the application does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the system and/or application passwords could be compromised. This requirement does not include emergency administration accounts, which are meant for access to the application in case of failure. These accounts are not required to have maximum password lifetime restrictions.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The vCenter Server must manage excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the effects of information flooding types of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by enabling Network I/O Control (NIOC).

**Rule ID:** `SV-258922r934424_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity. Managing excess capacity ensures sufficient capacity is available to counter flooding attacks. Employing increased capacity and service redundancy may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example, establishing selected usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The vCenter Server must provide an immediate real-time alert to the system administrator (SA) and information system security officer (ISSO), at a minimum, on every Single Sign-On (SSO) account action.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258923r934427_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Once an attacker establishes initial access to a system, they often attempt to create a persistent method of reestablishing access. One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to create a new account. They may also try to hijack an existing account by changing a password or enabling a previously disabled account. Therefore, all actions performed on accounts in the SSO domain much be alerted on in vCenter at a minimum and ideally on a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system as well. To ensure the appropriate personnel are alerted about SSO account actions, create a new vCenter alarm for the "com.vmware.sso.PrincipalManagement" event ID and configure the alert mechanisms appropriately.

### Rule: The vCenter Server must enable data at rest encryption for vSAN.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258929r934445_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Applications handling data requiring "data at rest" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest. Data encryption is a common technique used in environments that require additional levels of security. It consists of a process to ensure that data can only be consumed by systems that have appropriate levels of access. Approved systems must have and use the appropriate cryptographic keys to encrypt and decrypt the data. Systems that do not have the keys will not be able to consume the data in any meaningful way, as it will remain encrypted in accordance with the commonly used Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. vSAN supports Data-At-Rest Encryption and Data-in-Transit Encryption and uses an AES 256 cipher. Data is encrypted after all other processing, such as deduplication, is performed. Data at rest encryption protects data on storage devices in case a device is removed from the cluster.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

For example, frames on VLAN 1 from a Cisco physical switch will be untagged, because this is considered as the native VLAN. However, frames from ESXi specified as VLAN 1 will be tagged with a "1"; therefore, traffic from ESXi that is destined for the native VLAN will not be correctly routed (because it is tagged with a "1" instead of being untagged), and traffic from the physical switch coming from the native VLAN will not be visible (because it is not tagged). If the ESXi virtual switch port group uses the native VLAN ID, traffic from those virtual machines will not be visible to the native VLAN on the switch, because the switch is expecting untagged traffic.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

Backups of vCenter can now be made at a data and configuration level versus traditional storage/image-based backups. This reduces recovery time by letting the system administrator (SA) spin up a new vCenter while simultaneously importing the backed-up data. For sites that implement the Native Key Provider (NKP), introduced in 7.0 Update 2, regular vCenter backups are critical. In a recovery scenario where the virtual machine files are intact but vCenter was lost, the encrypted virtual machines will not be able to boot as their private keys were stored in vCenter after it was last backed up. When using the NKP, vCenter becomes critical to the virtual machine workloads and ceases to be just the control plane.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The vCenter Server must remove unauthorized port mirroring sessions on distributed switches.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258965r934553_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>The vSphere Distributed Virtual Switch can enable port mirroring sessions allowing traffic to be mirrored from one source to a destination. If port mirroring is configured unknowingly this could allow an attacker to observe network traffic of virtual machines.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The vCenter Server must not override port group settings at the port level on distributed switches.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258966r934556_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Port-level configuration overrides are disabled by default. Once enabled, this allows for different security settings to be set from what is established at the Port Group level. If overrides are not monitored, anyone who gains access to a VM with a less secure VDS configuration could exploit that broader access. If there are cases where particular VMs require unique configurations then a different port group with the required configuration should be created instead of overriding port group settings.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The vCenter Server must reset port configuration when virtual machines are disconnected.

**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Port-level configuration overrides are disabled by default. Once enabled, this allows for different security settings to be set from what is established at the Port Group level. If overrides are not monitored, anyone who gains access to a VM with a less secure VDS configuration could exploit that broader access. If any unknown or unauthorized per-port overrides exist and are not discarded when a virtual machine is disconnected from that port then a future virtual machine connected to that port may receive a less secure port.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

### Rule: The vCenter Server must enable data in transit encryption for vSAN.

**Rule ID:** `SV-258969r934565_rule`
**Severity:** medium

**Description:**
<VulnDiscussion>Transit encryption must be enabled to prevent unauthorized disclosure information and to protect the confidentiality of organizational information. vSAN data-in-transit encryption has the following characteristics: -vSAN uses AES-256 bit encryption on data in transit. -Forward secrecy is enforced for vSAN data-in-transit encryption. -Traffic between data hosts and witness hosts is encrypted. -File service data traffic between the VDFS proxy and VDFS server is encrypted. -vSAN file services inter-host connections are encrypted. -vSAN uses symmetric keys that are generated dynamically and shared between hosts. Hosts dynamically generate an encryption key when they establish a connection, and they use the key to encrypt all traffic between the hosts. You do not need a key management server to perform data-in-transit encryption. Each host is authenticated when it joins the cluster, ensuring connections only to trusted hosts are allowed. When a host is removed from the cluster, it is authentication certificate is removed. vSAN data-in-transit encryption is a cluster-wide setting. When enabled, all data and metadata traffic is encrypted as it transits across hosts.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>

**Check Text:**
If no clusters are enabled for vSAN, this is not applicable. From the vSphere Client, go to Host and Clusters. Select the vCenter Server >> Select the cluster >> Configure >> vSAN >> Services >> Data Services. Review the "Data-in-transit encryption" status. or From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the vCenter server, run the following commands: $vsanclusterconf = Get-VsanView -Id VsanVcClusterConfigSystem-vsan-cluster-config-system $vsanclusterconf.VsanClusterGetConfig((Get-Cluster -Name <cluster name>).ExtensionData.MoRef).DataInTransitEncryptionConfig Repeat these steps for each vSAN enabled cluster in the environment. If "Data-In-Transit encryption" is not enabled, this is a finding.
