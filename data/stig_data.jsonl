Invoking a system call is an expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace after the system call completes. Virtual system calls map into user space a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls. This allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the context switching expense. Virtual system calls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control of the return instruction pointer. Disabling virtual system calls help to prevent return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns.

Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best. Remote access is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-controlled network.

In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP\/IP address\/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session. RHEL 9 utilizes \/etc\/ssh\/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of \"ClientAliveInterval\" and \"ClientAliveCountMax\" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The \"ClientAliveInterval\" is a timeout interval in seconds, after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client.

Allocating an audit_backlog_limit of sufficient size is critical in maintaining a stable boot process. With an insufficient limit allocated, the system is susceptible to boot failures and crashes.

Invoking a system call is an expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace after the system call completes. Virtual Syscalls map into user space a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls. This allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the context switching expense. Virtual Syscalls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control of the return instruction pointer. Disabling vsyscalls help to prevent return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns. If the system intends to run containers based on RHEL 6 components, then virtual syscalls will need enabled so the components function properly.

Redzoning adds padding (red zones) around SLUB-allocated objects to detect overflows or underflows by triggering a fault when adjacent memory is accessed. SLUB canaries are often more efficient and provide stronger detection against buffer overflows compared to redzoning.

Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.<\/VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives><\/FalsePositives><FalseNegatives><\/FalseNegatives><Documentable>false<\/Documentable><Mitigations><\/Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance><\/SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts><\/PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools><\/ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl><\/MitigationControl><Responsibility><\/Responsibility><IAControls><\/IAControls>  \n**Check Text:**\nVerify RHEL 8 takes the appropriate action when the audit storage volume is full.

In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP\/IP address\/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session. RHEL 8 uses \/etc\/ssh\/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of \"ClientAliveInterval\" and \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is used to establish the inactivity threshold. The \"ClientAliveInterval\" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.

Invoking a system call is an expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace after the system call completes. Virtual system calls map into user space a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls.

Disabling virtual system calls help to prevent return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns.

Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can be either hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism. Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed pages, so any modification or reference to that page after being freed or before being initialized will be detected and prevented. This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance cost. Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory. init_on_free is a Linux kernel boot parameter that enhances security by initializing memory regions when they are freed, preventing data leakage. This process ensures that stale data in freed memory cannot be accessed by malicious programs. SLUB canaries add a randomized value (canary) at the end of SLUB-allocated objects to detect memory corruption caused by buffer overflows or underflows. Redzoning adds padding (red zones) around SLUB-allocated objects to detect overflows or underflows by triggering a fault when adjacent memory is accessed. SLUB canaries are often more efficient and provide stronger detection against buffer overflows compared to redzoning. SLUB canaries are supported in hardened Linux kernels like the ones provided by Linux-hardened. SLAB objects are blocks of physically contiguous memory. SLUB is the unqueued SLAB allocator.

The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.

This can be verified by acceptance\/validation processes in DOD or other government agencies. There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files in storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.

OpenShift provides a robust RBAC policy system that allows for authorization policies to be as detailed as needed. Additionally, there are two layers of RBAC policies. The first is Cluster RBAC policies which administrators can control who has what access to cluster level services. The other is Local RBAC policies, which allow project developers\/administrators to control what level of access users have to a given project or namespace. OpenShift provides a set of default roles out of the box, and additional roles may be added as needed. Each role has a set of rules controlling what access that role may have, and users and\/or groups may be bound to one or more roles. The cluster-admin cluster level RBAC role has complete super admin privileges and it is a required role for select cluster administrators to have. The OpenShift Container Platform includes a built-in image registry. The primary purpose is to allow users to create, import, and generally manage images running in the cluster. This registry is integrated with the authentication and authorization (RBAC) services on the cluster. Restricting access permissions and providing access only to the necessary components and resources within the OpenShift environment reduces the potential impact of security breaches and unauthorized activities.

Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators. It is common for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools with the purpose of providing the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs. To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed in order to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced.

OAuth is an open standard for secure authorization and authentication between different services. By setting a session token inactivity timeout, OpenShift reduces the risk of unauthorized access to a user's session if they become inactive or leave their session unattended. It helps protect against potential session hijacking or session replay attacks. OpenShift is designed to efficiently manage resources across the cluster. Active sessions consume resources such as memory and CPU. By setting timeouts, OpenShift can reclaim these resources if a session remains inactive for a certain duration. This helps optimize resource allocation and ensures that resources are available for other active sessions and workloads. OpenShift provides the ability for automatic time-out to debug node sessions on client versions starting with 4.8.36. By setting a time-out, OpenShift can manage the allocation of resources efficiently. It prevents the scenario where a debug session remains active indefinitely, potentially consuming excessive resources and impacting the performance of other applications running on the cluster. Allowing debug sessions to run indefinitely could introduce security risks. If a session is left unattended or unauthorized access is gained to a debug session, it could potentially compromise the application or expose sensitive information.

By implementing ASLR, OpenShift reduces the effectiveness of common attacks such as buffer overflow, return-oriented programming (ROP), and other memory corruption exploits. ASLR enhances the resilience of the OpenShift platform by introducing randomness into the memory layout. This randomization makes it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and launch successful attacks. Even if a vulnerability exists in the system, the randomized memory layout introduced by ASLR reduces the chances of the attacker being able to reliably exploit it, increasing the overall security of the platform. ASLR is particularly effective in mitigating remote code execution attacks. By randomizing the memory layout, ASLR prevents attackers from precisely predicting the memory addresses needed to execute malicious code. This makes it significantly more challenging for attackers to successfully exploit vulnerabilities and execute arbitrary code on the system. Protection of Shared Libraries: ASLR also protects shared libraries used by applications running on OpenShift. By randomizing the base addresses of shared libraries, ASLR makes it harder for attackers to leverage vulnerabilities in shared libraries to compromise applications or gain unauthorized access to the system.

Disabling the SSHD service reduces the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities associated with SSH access. SSH is a commonly targeted vector by malicious actors, and disabling the service eliminates the potential risks associated with unauthorized SSH access or exploitation of SSH-related vulnerabilities. By disabling SSHD, OpenShift can restrict access to the platform to only authorized channels and protocols. This helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access attempts and reduces the exposure to potential brute-force attacks or password-guessing attacks against SSH. Disabling SSHD encourages the use of more secure and controlled access mechanisms, such as API-based access or secure remote management tools provided by OpenShift.

OpenShift provides a robust RBAC policy system that allows for authorization policies to be as detailed as needed. Additionally, there are two layers of RBAC policies. The first is Cluster RBAC policies which administrators can control who has what access to cluster level services. The other is Local RBAC policies, which allow project developers\/administrators to control what level of access users have to a given project or namespace. OpenShift provides a set of default roles out of the box, and additional roles may be added as needed. Each role has a set of rules controlling what access that role may have, and users and\/or groups may be bound to one or more roles. The cluster-admin cluster level RBAC role has complete super admin privileges and it is a required role for select cluster administrators to have. The OpenShift Container Platform includes a built-in image registry. The primary purpose is to allow users to create, import, and generally manage images running in the cluster.

OAuth is an open standard for secure authorization and authentication between different services. By setting a session token inactivity timeout, OpenShift reduces the risk of unauthorized access to a user's session if they become inactive or leave their session unattended. It helps protect against potential session hijacking or session replay attacks. OpenShift is designed to efficiently manage resources across the cluster. Active sessions consume resources such as memory and CPU. By setting timeouts, OpenShift can reclaim these resources if a session remains inactive for a certain duration. This helps optimize resource allocation and ensures that resources are available for other active sessions and workloads. OpenShift provides the ability for automatic time-out to debug node sessions on client versions starting with 4.8.36. By setting a time-out, OpenShift can manage the allocation of resources efficiently. It prevents the scenario where a debug session remains active indefinitely, potentially consuming excessive resources and impacting the performance of other applications running on the cluster. Allowing debug sessions to run indefinitely could introduce security risks. If a session is left unattended or unauthorized access is gained to a debug session, it could potentially compromise the application or expose sensitive information.

By implementing ASLR, OpenShift reduces the effectiveness of common attacks such as buffer overflow, return-oriented programming (ROP), and other memory corruption exploits. ASLR enhances the resilience of the OpenShift platform by introducing randomness into the memory layout. This randomization makes it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and launch successful attacks. Even if a vulnerability exists in the system, the randomized memory layout introduced by ASLR reduces the chances of the attacker being able to reliably exploit it, increasing the overall security of the platform. ASLR is particularly effective in mitigating remote code execution attacks. By randomizing the memory layout, ASLR prevents attackers from precisely predicting the memory addresses needed to execute malicious code. This makes it significantly more challenging for attackers to successfully exploit vulnerabilities and execute arbitrary code on the system. Protection of Shared Libraries: ASLR also protects shared libraries used by applications running on OpenShift. By randomizing the base addresses of shared libraries, ASLR makes it harder for attackers to leverage vulnerabilities in shared libraries to compromise applications or gain unauthorized access to the system.

This allows an organization to define organizational policy to align with the SSP, combine it with standardized vendor-provided content, and periodically scan the platform in accordance with organization-defined policy.<\/VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives><\/FalsePositives><FalseNegatives><\/FalseNegatives><Documentable>false<\/Documentable><Mitigations><\/Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance><\/SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts><\/PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools><\/ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl><\/MitigationControl><Responsibility><\/Responsibility><IAControls><\/IAControls>  \n**Check Text:**\nIf Red Hat OpenShift Compliance Operator is not used, this check is Not Applicable.
